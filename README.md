# bootstrapped - confidence intervals made easy

**bootstrapped** is a Python library that allows you to build confidence intervals from data. This is useful in a variety of contexts - including during ad-hoc a/b test analysis.

## bootstrapped - Benefits
 * Efficient computation of percentile based confidence intervals
 * Functions to handle single populations and a/b test scenarios
 * Functions to understand [statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power) 

## Example Usage
```python
import numpy as np
import bootstrapped.bootstrap as bs
import bootstrapped.stats_functions as bs_stats

mean = 100
stdev = 10

population = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=stdev, size=50000)

# take 1k 'samples' from the larger population
samples = population[:1000]

print(bs.bootstrap(samples, stat_func=bs_stats.mean))
>> 100.08  (99.46, 100.69)

print(bs.bootstrap(samples, stat_func=bs_stats.std))
>> 9.49  (9.92, 10.36)
```

* [Bootstrap A/B Testing](https://github.com/facebookincubator/bootstrapped/blob/master/examples/bootstrap_ab_testing.ipynb)
* More notebooks can be found in the [examples/](https://github.com/facebookincubator/bootstrapped/tree/master/examples) directory 

## Requirements
**bootstrapped** requires numpy and pandas. The power analysis plotting function requires matplotlib. statsmodels is used in some of the examples.

## Installation
```bash
# clone bootstrapped 
cd bootstrapped 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
python setup.py install
```

## How bootstrapped works
tldr - Percentile based confidence intervals based on bootstrap re-sampling with replacement.

Bootstrapped generates confidence intervals given input data by:
* Generating a large number of samples from the input (re-sampling)
* For each re-sample, calculate the mean (or whatever statistic you care about)
* Of these results, calculate the 2.5th and 97.5 percentiles (default range)
* Use this as the 95% confidence interval
