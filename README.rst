bootstrapped - confidence intervals made easy
=============================================

**bootstrapped** is a Python library that allows you to build confidence
intervals from data. This is useful in a variety of contexts - including
during ad-hoc a/b test analysis.

Motivating Example - A/B Test
-----------------------------

Imagine we own a website and think changing the color of a 'subscribe'
button will improve signups. One method to measure the improvement is to
conduct an A/B test where we show 50% of people the old version and 50%
of the people the new version. We can use the bootstrap to understand
how much the button color improves responses and give us the error bars
associated with the test - this will give us lower and upper bounds on
how good we should expect the change to be!

The Gist - Mean of a Sample
---------------------------

Given a sample of data - we can generate a bunch of new samples by
're-sampling' from what we have gathered. We calculate the mean for each
generated sample. We can use the means from the generated samples to
understand the variation in the larger population and can construct
error bars for the true mean.

bootstrapped - Benefits
-----------------------

-  Efficient computation of confidence intervals
-  Functions to handle single populations and a/b tests
-  Functions to understand `statistical
   power <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power>`__
-  Multithreaded support to speed-up bootstrap computations
-  Dense and sparse array support

Example Usage
-------------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import bootstrapped.bootstrap as bs
    import bootstrapped.stats_functions as bs_stats

    mean = 100
    stdev = 10

    population = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=stdev, size=50000)

    # take 1k 'samples' from the larger population
    samples = population[:1000]

    print(bs.bootstrap(samples, stat_func=bs_stats.mean))
    >> 100.08  (99.46, 100.69)

    print(bs.bootstrap(samples, stat_func=bs_stats.std))
    >> 9.49  (9.92, 10.36)

Requirements
------------

**bootstrapped** requires numpy. The power analysis functions require
matplotlib and pandas.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install bootstrapped

How bootstrapped works
----------------------

**bootstrapped** provides pivotal (aka empirical) based confidence
intervals based on bootstrap re-sampling with replacement. The
percentile method is also available.
